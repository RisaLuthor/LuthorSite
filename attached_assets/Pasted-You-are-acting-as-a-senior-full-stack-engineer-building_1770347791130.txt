You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer building a production-ready admin control plane.

Goal:
Use the existing Core Dashboard as the admin landing page after login for the Luthor.Tech / RMLuthor.us website.

Requirements:

1. Routing & Structure
- Implement a protected admin route structure:
  /admin/login
  /admin/dashboard
  /admin/projects
  /admin/modules
  /admin/settings
- The Core Dashboard must load at /admin/dashboard and be inaccessible without authentication.

2. Authentication
- Implement backend authentication (session-based or JWT).
- Create a secure login page at /admin/login.
- Credentials must be validated on the backend.
- Store admin credentials in environment variables (ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD).
- On successful login, redirect the user to /admin/dashboard.

3. Authorization Middleware
- Add backend middleware to protect all /admin/* routes.
- If the user is not authenticated, redirect them to /admin/login.
- Ensure authorization is enforced server-side (not frontend-only).

4. Session / Token Handling
- Persist login state across page refreshes.
- Add logout functionality that clears the session/token and redirects to /admin/login.

5. Dashboard Integration
- Reuse the existing Core Dashboard UI without redesigning it.
- Connect dashboard data to existing API endpoints (projects, modules, metrics).
- Ensure CRUD actions remain functional behind authentication.

6. Security & Configuration
- Move all secrets to environment variables.
- Add basic input validation and error handling.
- Log authentication events to the server console.

7. Documentation
- Update README.md to include:
  - Admin login flow
  - Route structure
  - Security model
  - Environment variables required
  - How to run locally vs production

Constraints:
- Do not expose the admin dashboard publicly.
- Do not remove existing functionality.
- Do not hardcode credentials.
- Keep architecture clean and scalable.

This admin dashboard is the control plane for the platform and must be treated as production infrastructure.
