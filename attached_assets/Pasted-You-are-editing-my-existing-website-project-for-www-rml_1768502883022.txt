You are editing my existing website project for www.rmluthor.us.

Goal:
Add a new top-level navigation item called "Labs" with Luthor.Tech branding. 
This section showcases my graduate capstone research and applied R&D systems.

Design Style:
- Dark mode
- Sleek, high-tech
- Premium feel
- Subtle glow accents
- Clean spacing
- Modern sans-serif typography
- Matches existing site aesthetic

NAVIGATION
1) Add "Labs" to the main navbar (place near Projects or after Projects).
2) Route should be: /labs

PAGE: /labs

HERO SECTION
Title: Labs
Subtitle: Graduate capstone research + Luthor.Tech applied R&D.
Subtext:
"Distributed architecture. Persistent memory. Zero-trust security. Emotional intelligence. Ethical AI design."

Buttons:
Primary: "View GitHub"
Link: https://github.com/RisaLuthor

Secondary: "Read the Capstone"
Link: /projects (or placeholder if needed)
